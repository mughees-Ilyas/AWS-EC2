# AWS-EC2
Launch AWS EC2 instance using web interface.
## Notes
* I am not using Sass, minifier or any other bundler to keep the build simple.
* all the code is in ECMA Script 5 (ES5) standard so all the browsers can understand it natively.

## Task 
Create a simple script, using your language of choice, that creates an AWS EC2 instance and outputs its launch time. The script should:
* Utilize the AWS API
* Accept the arguments: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, INSTANCE_TYPE
